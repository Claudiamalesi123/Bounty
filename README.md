### Step 1: Understanding `deleteUsercombinedCode.js`

The `deleteUsercombinedCode.js` file integrates backend and frontend functionalities for deleting a user after authentication. Here’s a breakdown of how the code works:

1. **Backend Setup and Middleware**:
   - **Express Initialization**: The Express framework is set up to handle server requests and responses.
   - **Body Parser**: `bodyParser.json()` is used to parse incoming request bodies in JSON format.
   - **Authentication and Authorization Middleware**: Simple placeholder functions for `authentication` and `authorisation` are provided to simulate user authentication and role-based access control.

2. **User Deletion Logic**:
   - **`delete_user_by_username` Function**: This function handles the core logic for deleting a user. It checks if the user exists in the mock `UserModel` and then deletes the user if found. Error handling is included to manage different scenarios such as user not found or server errors.

3. **Route Handling**:
   - **POST Route for User Deletion**: A route (`/auth/delete/user`) is set up to handle POST requests for deleting a user. It applies the `authentication` and `authorisation` middleware to ensure that the request is authenticated and authorized.
   - **HTML Content and Frontend JavaScript**: The server responds with an HTML page containing a form for deleting a user. The form’s submission is handled by embedded JavaScript, which sends a POST request to the backend route with the username to be deleted.

4. **Frontend Interaction**:
   - **Delete User Form**: A form in the HTML allows users to input a username to delete.
   - **JavaScript Event Listener**: The JavaScript code listens for form submissions, prevents default form submission, and makes an asynchronous POST request to the backend to delete the user.

5. **Server Listening**:
   - The Express server listens on `PORT 4001` and serves the web page and handles user deletion requests.

By combining both backend and frontend code in `deleteUsercombinedCode.js`, the file provides a complete solution for user deletion functionality, demonstrating both server-side logic and client-side interaction.
